## Introduction

###1. Conceptual Framework:

The idea that the universe is a computer or a computational process might seem, for many, like a category error; nonetheless, computers are things made from the same ‘stuff’ the universe is made of. Digital philosophy is a modern re-interpretation of  monist metaphysics, one that envisions the universe as a singleness, ONE substance from which everything else arises equally, without particular names and forms; these two last aspects of our reality are confined to the human psyche. Digital philosophy replaces monads with aspects of the theory of cellular automaton. In order to take this stream of thought seriously we need to get past all non-trivial barriers.  The idea is that computation is not a metaphor for the universe, nor is the physical evolution of the universe analogous to digital. The universe can be then referenced as a gigantic ongoing computation just as it can be said to be a bunch of particles interacting energetically via some physical laws.

A cellular automaton (CA) is a discrete computational model able to simulate complex dynamics in systems with simple initial rules. CAs are often used to study aspects of evolution, genetics, physics, philosophy, among others fields of knowledge. This workshop will be dedicated to explore deep ontological aspects of CAs; metaphysics, digital philosophy and digital physics will become our common conceptual ground. We will continue by understanding basic models and rules used in this type of computational universes (CAs), while thinking on ways to theorize, speculate, and construct artistic discourses around them. 

in_search_of_the_garden of_eden derives from the concept of Garden of Eden (GOE) used in Cellular Automaton studies, which at the same time emerges from Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Catholicism, Christianism, etc.), In CAs theory, GOE is a very unique pattern of cells/units that does not have a origin; meaning that there is no possible configuration in any CA universe from where this can emerge. The idea of a GOE in computational theories is as interesting and technical as provoking and critical.

The workshop is concept-tech based, which means that various technical skills will be explored during the totality of the course: openFrameworks/c++ programming, electronics/physical computing, among others.

###2. Technical Skills to Teach:

Besides the conceptual framework of the workshop, the following technical skills will be taught:

#####2.1. Cellular automaton programing in OpenFrameworks:

  a) Elementary Cellular Automaton

  b) Turmite: Langton's ant
  
  c) Conway's game of life

#####2.2. Arduino Workshop: building a physical cellular automaton (CA) system:
    
  a) Arduino basic programming and logic with electronics
  
  b) Programming sensors and actuators based on CA rules. 
  
  c) ATTiny85 microcontroller Workshop
  
  d) Example of CA using LEDs and basic signals, no code (self-contained units)

###3. General Requirements:

The workshop will be instructed entirely in English. If you don't feel comfortable with English  its recommended to come with someone who helps you translate.

#####3.1 System Requirements:

The entire workshop will be given using a UNIX based platform  (LINUX or OSX) – Windows users are encouraged to install a partition with either UBUNTU LINUX or MINT.  If you are comfortable with windows and can handle any software and dependencies installation processes by your own, then it is totally fine. The workshop staff has limited knowledge about windows.

#####3.2 Required Basic Programming skills:

It is important that selected participants come prepared with all the following mentioned basic skills, since the workshop time is limited to more specific conceptual and more advanced technical topics. In case you are not familiar with one or more of the mentioned programming languages or skills please refer to our resources section with some suggested tutorial pages in order to get prepared for the workshop. The required technical knowledge is the following:

**OpenFrameworks/C++:** simple drawing, shapes, general oF structure, arrays, data types, for loops, conditionals, functions, classes.

**Arduino:** Serial Communication, digitalWrite/read, analogWrite/read, for loops, if statements
Electronics: Basic understanding of electricity, ohms law, binary, basic soldering.
